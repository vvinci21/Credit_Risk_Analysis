# Credit_Risk_Analysis

Evaluate several machine learning models to assess credit card risk.
## Overview:
Use six machine learning models to evaluate which has the highest accuracy and precision in evaluating credit card risk.
## Results:
### Native Random Oversampling Model - Accuracy Score= 0.68

### Easy Ensemble Model - Accuracy Score= 0.93

## Summary:
The summary of model results is presented in order of highest accuracy score to lowest accuracy score.
* The Easy Ensemble model has the highest accuracy score of 0.93 and the F-1 score for low risk of 0.97 is also the highest. 
  *  The recommended model for credit card analysis would be the Easy Ensemble model.
* The Balanced Random Rainforest model has the second highest accuracy score at 0.79 and the F-1 score is 0.93. 
* The Na√Øve Random Oversampling model has an accuracy of 0.68 and a F-1 score of 0.81 for low risk. 
* The SMOTE model has an accuracy score of 0.64 and the F-1 score is 0.79 for low risk.
* The SMOTEENN model has an accuracy score of 0.64 and the F-1 score is 72 for low risk.
* UnderSampling has the lowest accuracy score at 0.53 and F-1 score of 0.62. 
  * Because of how low both scores are the Undersampling model is not recommended for credit card risk analysis.
